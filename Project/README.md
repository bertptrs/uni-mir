# Packagist search engine

This project attempts to create a better searchable version of
Packagist, the PHP package repository.

## Dependencies

To compile and run this program, you need:

- GCC with C++14 support
- cURL (with development headers)
- Python3
- NetworkX for Python 3

This all can be available on ISSC machines, but requires some setup. You
can `source environment_issc` to attempt to set this up automatically,
or alternatively set this up by hand.
