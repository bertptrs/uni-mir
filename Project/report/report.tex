\begin{abstract}
	In the last few years, PHP as a development platform has been through some large changes. One of the key reasons for this is the emergence of Composer package manager, and its central package repository Packagist. Using these tools, library interoperability is easier than ever before.

	However, library discovery is still hard, with the search functionality of the Packagist being rather lacking, with a very broad text search and a counterintuitive ordering. In this paper, we create a new search engine for Packagist with improved text search and better ordering using pagerank.
